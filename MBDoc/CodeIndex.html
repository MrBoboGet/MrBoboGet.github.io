The purpose of this document is to server as an introduction and overview of the codebase for MBDoc, and describe the main abstractions for the implementation. For more detalied descriptions see the documentation for the individual classes, go here <a href="#" style="color: red;">here</a>. <br><br>

<h1 id="Directory structure" style = "text-align: center;">1 Directory structure</h1><br>
    This project follows the <a href="#" style="color: red;">MBPDS</a> . This means that all of the source files     can be found at the top part of the project directory, and that they use     only relative includes, which means that all of the sources can be moved to     another directory and compiled without problem. The folder Doc is where the     documentation for the project is located, and MUST have no affect on     compiling the library and executable.  <br><br>

<h1 id="The pipeline" style = "text-align: center;">2 The pipeline</h1><br>
In order to create documents from MBDoc files there are 4 distinct steps. Build Specification, Document filesystem creation, Preprocessing+parsing and finally compilation. <br><br>

<h2 id="Build Specification" >2.1 Build Specification</h2><br>
        In order to compile something in the first place, the files that is a         part of build has to be specified in some way. This can either be          explicitly specified with a MBDocBuild.json, or implicitly specified on         the command line. More on the build process and it's design can be found         <a href="Building.html">here</a>. <br><br>

        In the codebase however, the build specficitation is rather simple.  The         structure is described fully by the <a href="#" style="color: red;">MBDoc::DocumentBuild</a> struct, and         only the creation of it is implemented by it. It is then passed as is to         the next step, and is mainly read from. More importantly, the document         build only parses and validates that the files and sub builds and their         sub builds and so on exist on disk, but no sources are actually parsed,         which means that invalid sources are detected further along. <br><br>

<h2 id="Document filesystem creation" >2.2 Document filesystem creation</h2><br>
        This part of the pipeline creates the "document filesystem", which is an          integral part in how references are resolved, and how the compiler         can access the soures to compile. This also provides a natural output         structures for many formats like HTML. <br><br>

        This part of the pipeline is implemented by <a href="#" style="color: red;">MBDoc::DocumentFilesystem</a>,         and takes as input a parsed <a href="#" style="color: red;">MBDoc::DocumentBuild</a>. It also implements a         generic interface, <a href="#" style="color: red;">MBDoc::ReferenceResolver</a>, that can be used to create         custom reference resolvers.  <br><br>

        For more information about how references are resolved and the design         go <a href="LinkResolving.html">here</a>. <br><br>

<h3 id="Invalid references" >2.2.1 Invalid references</h3><br>
            Another design consideration, is at which point unresolved             references create an error. In traditional C/C++, unresolved             references are only found at the end of the compilation process, when             all the output is already created.  This is however generally             something that is suboptimal, if your document is invalid it is             something that you want to find out quickly.  <br><br>

            However, as semantic's might have a need to provide their own             reference solvers, references might be valid despite not being able             to be resolved by the resolving of <a href="#" style="color: red;">MBDoc::DocumentBuild</a>. <br><br>

<h2 id="Preprocessing and parsing" >2.3 Preprocessing and parsing</h2><br>
        Preprocessing and parsing is currently done together by         <a href="#" style="color: red;">MBDoc::ParsingContext</a>.  The main reason for this is because a lot of         infrastructure in preprocessing and parsing is the same, and because it         ensures that eventual intermediaries can be skipped. The class has many         functions, but most are convenience. The <a href="#" style="color: red;">SemanticallyAuthorative</a>         function requires only an input stream and a path to assign the         document, which is needed as document paths are used for reference         creation. Most function are provided to make it easier to create         relative paths, as that's often needed when creating a project with         multiple sub builds.  <br><br>

        This class is designed to be able to be used stand alone, and isn't         designed to be a separate part of the pipeline in software and is used         directly by <a href="#" style="color: red;">MBDoc::DocumentFilesystem</a>. This is however the class         that is solely responsible for implementing the grammar of the         markup language. <br><br>

        How to use and interpret the structs and classes used in <a href="#" style="color: red;">MBDoc::DocumentSource</a>          are described in <a href="#" style="color: red;">FormatDatastructures</a>, which is neccessary to         understand if one wants to write a new compiler. <br><br>

<h2 id="Compiling" >2.4 Compiling</h2><br>
        This is the part where the implementation for the individual output         formats and semantics are. In the          <a href="index.html">philosophy of theproject</a>          it is described how output formats are always         linkable. The way this is achieved is naturally dependant on the         format, but more importantly, is the same for all semantics. But in         order to facilitate easy creation of new target format and semantics, a         generic abstract class is provided that specifices the needed interface         to compile a MBDoc build, <i>with the same semantics</i>. The reason why a         mixed semantic build is still not as easily implementable, is that they         don't guarantee a uniform output structure. One semantic might bundle         up all files in a large document, which means that the way          <a href="#" style="color: red;">absolute packets paths</a> are serialized is not trivial, and not         necceserially genericly solvable. Some formats like HTTP might solve         this by just having a map from absolute packet path to relative url as         a string. But as other formats might not encode references in a easily         insertable string, this interace might not work. This is currently a         work in progress on the compilation part. <br><br>

        The interface for the class is currently very simple, it only has to be         able a compile <a href="#" style="color: red;">MBDoc::DocumentSource</a>, along with user provided format         specific command line arguments. <br><br>

<h2 id="DocCLI" >2.5 DocCLI</h2><br>
        <a href="#" style="color: red;">MBDoc::DocCLI</a> is the class "closest to main", which is responsible for         handling all of the user input, for documentation of what options are         supported and what they do go <a href="CLI.html">here</a>. The class is however         only ment to work as a glue combining all of the individual parts of the         project together into a convenient user interface, and MUST NOT         implement functionality that requires understanding of the internals of         the other classes, and can only use the public functions exposed by the         other classes. Preferably, it should be feasible to implement one's own         CLI with the library part of the project, instead of acting as a map for         different command line options. <br><br>

These are the most central classes for the codebase, but naturally there are many more defined, mainly structs that are more data oriented. To get a complete documentation for the individual classes and functions, go to <a href="#" style="color: red;">Code</a>. <br><br>
