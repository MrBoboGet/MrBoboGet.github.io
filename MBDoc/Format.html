The purpose of this document is to describe the target goals for the MBDoc markup language and it's design, as well as giving a complete description of all it's current components.  This document is needed in order to understand the semantics and purpose for all the different elements of a MBDoc, but to undestand how this is then represented programatically, go <a href="#" style="color: red;">here</a>. <br><br>

<h1 id="The goals for the format" style = "text-align: center;">1 The goals for the format</h1><br>
The main goals of the project and consequently the markup language is described in <a href="index.html">here</a>, and is the definitve document for the motivation behind all of the design. However, how these goals and the markup language interact is described in this part. The goals here are the goals the format need to support in order to fulfill the requiremnts outlined.  <br><br>

<h2 id="Unobtrusive syntax" >1.1 Unobtrusive syntax</h2><br>
        When writing documentation, the main goal is that it is easy to get the         desired content without needing to constantly read the documentation for         the documentation writing program itself. <br><br>

<h2 id="Easy to create references" >1.2 Easy to create references</h2><br>
        Writing documentation is like lots of things, easy when the scale is         small. However, once a lot of documents are created and the file         structure starts getting complicated, copy pasting absolute URL's starts         to get unfeasibly, stuff breaks and gets renamed and so on. There must a         easy way to create references to other documents, that doesn't require a         complete understanding if the whole project structure, that is         preferably resistant to restructuring, that can reference documents from         other completely separate projects, and that is intuitive to write in. <br><br>

<h2 id="Extensability" >1.3 Extensability</h2><br>
        No finite amount of elements can support all of the potential         functionality and features there is, so the format has to be able to         include extensions in some way. <br><br>

<h2 id="Easy to create compilers for" >1.4 Easy to create compilers for</h2><br>
        In order to efficiently target multiple output formats, creating a         compiler should not be require to much work. If the formats is to         complicated, many bugs may be introdced from the conversion to different         formats, and if not all functionality is supported for all targets         writing documentation becomes difficult if one needs to constantly         reason about incompatabilites.   <br><br>

<h1 id="The Elements" style = "text-align: center;">2 The Elements</h1><br>
    The following is a description of all the components of all the elements     that constitues a document and their purpose, that is supposed to describe     their functioanlity. The design behind these components are seperate from     how they are in turn represented in syntax, which can be found      <a href="#" style="color: red;">here</a>. <br><br>

<h2 id="The Format Element" >2.1 The Format Element</h2><br>
        All but the simplest text files have some sort of structure. This can be         as easy as dividing it up into paragraphs, or having some simple         headings.  When writing a book, there might be different chapters that         have different names, and when writing a tutorial there might be         different distinct steps. The "Format element" is a          <a href="#Easy to create compilers for">simple</a>         and <a href="#Unobtrusive syntax">concise</a> abstraction         for all of the different ways a document can be formatted. <br><br>

        The format element has the following properties: It has a name that can         be <a href="#" style="color: red;">reffered to</a>, it can contain          <a href="#The Block Element">Block elements</a>, and it can contain other formats         elements. <br><br>

        The properties of the format elements is intentionally very limited. The         purpose is to both be as general as possible, and to defer as much         actual formatting as possible to the semantic. The assumption here, is         that often times the way the described format is represented visually         often times something that is difficult to describe exactly, how much         indent should the header have, should it use a different font etc, and         something that can be automatically genereted to look right. Take the         book example. A book typically consists of chapters, that have names and         contain text. This is something that can be perfectly described with         this system. <br><br>

<h2 id="The Block Element" >2.2 The Block Element</h2><br>
        A format element is in and of itself not very intresting, and needs to         contain something. The block element is all elements that describes any         sort of content to be displayed, and that can be put arbitrarily in a         document without changings it's semantics. The following block elements         are currently defined. <br><br>

<h3 id="Paragraph" >2.2.1 Paragraph</h3><br>
            A paragraph is a list of <a href="#The Text Element">text elements</a>. <br><br>

<h3 id="CodeBlock" >2.2.2 CodeBlock</h3><br>
            A Codeblock is raw text that is already formatted, and should be             included in the output as is, with the possible inclusion of syntax             highlighting. <br><br>

<h3 id="Media Reference" >2.2.3 Media Reference</h3><br>
            A media reference is the inclusion of a media file, typically an             image or video.  <br><br>

<h2 id="The Text Element" >2.3 The Text Element</h2><br>
        The text element is in many ways the fundemantal unit of content, the         majority of text are displayed through text elements. A block element         can contain text elements, but a text element can't have any sub         components and has to be atomic. The main property of the text element         is it's ability to be displayed next to other text elements, and should         always be displayed as some sort of text. As all text elements are         displayed as text, they also share these common modifiers: Bold,Italic,         asdasd. The currently defined text element are as follows: <br><br>

<h3 id="RawText" >2.3.1 RawText</h3><br>
            Raw text is just text that is meant to be displayed, and most likely             constitues the larget part of any document. <br><br>

<h3 id="The Reference" >2.3.2 The Reference</h3><br>
            This is next to the format element and RawText, the most important             element for the functionality of MBDoc. This is what creats a             reference, hyperlink, a way to go to other documents. It has 1             mandatory component, the reference identifier, and optionally a part             that describes what text should be displayed. <br><br>

            To undestand how references are resolved, go             <a href="LinkResolving.html">here</a>. <br><br>

<h2 id="The Directive" >2.4 The Directive</h2><br>
        The direcitive is a catch all category of markup that doesn't fall under         any other category, or requires information that doesn't follow a         recursive tree structure.  The archetypically example of a directive is         the "toc" diretive, which inserts a table of contents for the currents         document. In order to create this table information about every other         format in the document is needed.  They are also allowed to have rules         defining where they can be put that doesn't mimic that of other element         types, such as not being allowed inside a format element. <br><br>

        This also means that directives have no guarantees of the type inserted,         and are often times inherently dependant on the compiler to make more         compliated calculations, and support functionality that means that         compilation aren't neccisarilly implementable as a simple recursive         algorithm. This means that directives, unlike the previous elements are         allowed to conditionally supported. However, there are also a set of         directives that MUST be supported by all compilers, which are listed         here. <br><br>

        A directive is uniquely identified by a name, and can also have a list         of strings given as arguments. <br><br>

<h3 id="toc" >2.4.1 toc</h3><br>
            The toc directives inserts a table of contents describing the file,             that is to say the format elements. The contents must link to the             appropriate format element if able. <br><br>

            This diretive takes no arguments, and can be included wherever. <br><br>

<h3 id="title" >2.4.2 title</h3><br>
            A common pattern when making files, is to have a top level header or             name of the document that isn't meant to be included as format             element. Creating a table of content can then be confusing of the             name is given a format element, as this most likely links to empty             content. Headings describing the file might also be somthing that is             uniquely supported by the given semantic or target, which can then             be exposed through this directive. <br><br>

            This directive MUST have 1 argument, giving the name of the header,             and cannot be a part of a format element. <br><br>

<h1 id="The syntax" style = "text-align: center;">3 The syntax</h1><br>
    The syntax for the format is heavily inspired by other "lightweight markup     languages", and mainly markdown. The advantage of using a syntax similar to     another existing format is that it's easier to remember and getting started.     The syntax has therefore strived to be very similar to markdown, but by no     means so is the format striving to be an extension to markdown or a superset     of the syntax. <br><br>

    The syntax description is devided into 2 parts, one formal part with a     bnf-like description, and one part describing it in prose, and discussing     the design decisions. <br><br>

<h2 id="BNF" >3.1 BNF</h2><br>
<pre>WhiteSpace = "[[:space:]]+"
StartLine = "^|\\n";
EndLine = "$|\\n";

RawText = "[[:alpha:][:whitespace:]]";
Reference = '@'('[' RawText ']' '(' RawText ')' | "[[:alpnum:]_]");
UnmodifiedText = RawText | Reference;
TextElement = UnmodifiedText | '*' UnmodifiedText '*' |  '**' UnmodifiedText '**' |  '***' UnmodifiedText '***';

CodeBlock = [WhiteSpace] '```' RawText* [WhiteSpace] '```';
MediaReference = '![' Path ']';

BlockElement = CodeBlock | MediaReference | Paragraph;

SubFormat = '_#' ( BlockElement | Directive | SubFormat)* '/#';
TopFormat = '#_' ( BlockElement | Directive | FormatElement)* '/_';
RegulatFormat = '#' ( BlockElement | Directive|SubFormat)*;
FormatElement = SubFormat | TopFormat | RegularFormat;
Document = FormatElement*;</pre><h2 id="Prose/Semantics" >3.2 Prose/Semantics</h2><br>
        As described previously, a document consists of a number of formats,         either the default or explicitly named ones. A large majority of         documents, for example github README's are written only using headings         seperating the different parts of a document, that contain either images         or text. A goal of the synttax is to be able to write these kind of         documents conveniently, and it therefore requires that it's easy         specifing consecutive formats beloning to the same top format. <br><br>

        This leads to the most prominent design decision of the syntax, the way         formats are specified. A format that starts with "# etc" belongs to the         nearest "TopFormat", or the top level of the document of no "TopFormats"         are specified above it. It also serves as a delimiter for others         formats, which means that writing consecutive "# etc" lines         automatically separates into consecutive formats, and there is no need         to keep track of the "end of the format" as it would be with an XML-like         syntax. However, with this syntax alone it would be impossible to         specify nested formats. To solve this, the "SubFormat" and "TopFormat"         is needed. <br><br>

        The "SubFormat", which begins with "_#" and ends with "/#", becomes a         child of the current format. This means, that if we have a file looking         like  <br><br>

<pre>Paragraph belonging to the top, "Default" format.

# NewFormat

NewFormat paragraph

_# SubNewFormat
SubNewFormatContetn
/#</pre>        the format named "SubNewFormat" is a part of the format element named         "NewFormat". This makes it easy to individual child elements of the         current format. SubFormats can in turn contain subformats, which means         that if we have a file on the form  <br><br>

<pre>Paragraph belonging to the top, "Default" format.

# NewFormat

NewFormat paragraph

_# SubNewFormat
SubNewFormatContetn
    _# SubSubFormat
        SubSubContent
    /#
/#</pre>        The format named SubSubContent is a child of SubNewFormat. These 2         structres are in theory all that is needed to describe arbirary nesting         of formats, but many times this is inconvenient. A typical situation is         that there exist 1 large heading, constisting of multiple smaller         headings, that in turn consist of a list of 3-5 sub headings. When         writing a list of formats, we ideally want to skip neading to specify         end delimiters, as it easier to write in and improves the readability.         This brings us to the "TopFormat". <br><br>

        The "TopFormat" begins with "#_" and is delimited with "/_", and <i>can         include</i> "RegularFormats", as well as "SubFormats" and nested         "TopFormats". The main point here is, that "RegularFormat" written         within a "TopFormat" becomes a child of it, instead of the top of the         document. This means writing them as "SubFormats" is uneccesary, but         still valid. For example, take a document structured like this:  <br><br>

<pre>Paragraph belonging to the top, "Default" format.

# NewFormat

NewFormat paragraph

_# SubNewFormat
SubNewFormatContetn
    _# SubSubFormat

    #_ NewTopFormat
        NewTopFormatContent
        # SubNewTopFormat
            SubNewTopFormat content 

    /_
/_
</pre>        Here, "SubTopFormat1-3" is a child of "TopFormat", and "NewTopFormat"         aswell. "SubNewTopFormat" is a child of "NewTopFormat" however. <br><br>

        Note about the examples, the indent is not necessary for correct         parsing, and is completely ignored, but included for better readbility. <br><br>

        Important to remember, is there are no semantic differences between         these type of format elements. All format elements are the same, the         only difference in the syntax comes from how to describe the         parent-child structure, and aside of from that the content they can         contain is exactly the same. <br><br>
