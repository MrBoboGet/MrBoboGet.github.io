This document describes the attributes that are available in most semantics, but most importantly describes the design behind the attributes and how the should be defined. <br><br>

Attributes are partly included to allow arbitrary extensions. This also means that it's impossible for this document to describe all possible attributes. The attributes that are supported are inherently relative to a specific semantic, and a complete documentation of what attributes are supported can be found for their respective documents.  <br><br>

The rest of this document descrbies the design behind the attributes and the way they are intended to be supported, and then describes the most common attributess and how they are used.  <br><br>

<h1 id="Definiton and syntax" style = "text-align: center;">1 Definiton and syntax</h1><br>
    Attributes are meta data that can be given to either a format element or     block element. The meta data isn't included explicitly as a part of the     document, but can depending on the compiler change the way the block or     format element is presented. They are one of the primary extension     mechanisms, the other being directives. A block element or foramt element     can optionally have a <i>AttributeList</i> describing which attributes it has <br><br>

<h2 id="Syntax" >1.1 Syntax</h2><br>
<pre>Name = "[[:alpha:]_]+";
String  = '"' "([^\\]|\\.)*" '"';
ValueAttribute = Name [[:space:]]* '=' [[:space:]]* (Name|String);
AttributeList = '[[' ((Name|ValueAttribute) [,| ])*  ']]'</pre>        A AttributeList contains as it name implies, a list of attributes. An         attribute is either just a name, denoting the existance of an attribute, or         the name of the attribute plus a string argument. The quotes for a <i>String</i>         value are ommited in the argument, so Name=Value is equivalent to         Name="Value". <br><br>

    It is then up to the compiler to determine how the existance or value +     existance of a attribute is to be interpreted. <br><br>

<h1 id="Attributes and arbirary semantics" style = "text-align: center;">2 Attributes and arbirary semantics</h1><br>
    While  attributes are ment to support a extensions mechanism for the markup     language, so are they still very different in their use cases in comparison     to for example tex libraries. Tex provides a feature rich program with     high controll of how the output looks, which means that packets are user     extensions can work entirely without the need for editing the underlying     program. These may not be true extensions to the language, but they serve     the same purpose, to provide functionality that doesn't exist from the     beginning or is inconvenient to use efficiently. This is something MBDoc     can't provide. <br><br>

    MBDoc is be design very limited in it's capabilities, and strives to be     compatible with very limited target's like text files. Another goal of the     markup language is that it can be compiled to arbitrary semantics and still     look good, or as intended. While a attribute might for one semantic might     mean that consecutive block elements should be placed in paralell instead of     after another, so is this something that is impossible, or atleast not     somehting that can be good in a good way, on a terminal. But more     importantly, if one starts writing the document with the assumption that the     block elements are parallel, so is the content of the source file not     compatible with semantics that doesn't support this attribute.  <br><br>

    In order to avoid these problems so are there a couple of guidelines that     need to be followed in order to ensure that the attribute is compatible with     the design of MBDoc. <br><br>

<h2 id="Focus on semantics rather than rendering" >2.1 Focus on semantics rather than rendering</h2><br>
        In order to ensure that an attribute isn't incompatible with different         semantics, so should the focus be on the semantics rather than how it         looks. This means that even for formats that support very high control         of the rendering, so should this functionality not be exposed through an         attribute, but instead implicitly used in order to deliver on the         intented semantic for a more genaral purpose. <br><br>

        A good example of a attribute that can be implemented differently is the         "Note" attribute. On the default HTML and terminal semantic so is the         implmeneted through adding the text "Note:" with a highligt. But another         HTML semantic might render this as and adjecet div with the note, as         some mathematical papers do.  <br><br>

        This means that no matter which semantic you use, so should the intended         behaviour of  the note block be the same. <br><br>

<h2 id="An attribute must be able to be ignored" >2.2 An attribute must be able to be ignored</h2><br>
        This is in some ways the single most important guide line for making         cusetom attributes. If any attribute defined can be ignored so is the         inter format/semantic comaptibility of the attribute greatly improved,         and gurantees that even tough the document doesn't have the ideal look,         atleast compiles and has the right contents. <br><br>

        But what it means to be safely ignorable is not neccesarilly obvious.         But take the "Note" attribute as an example. The content of the note         block is the same whether or not the semantic recognizes the option or         not, the difference is just that no special emphasis is but on it, which         means that is ignorable.  <br><br>

        Some attibutes that was scraped for this reason is for example the "ID"         attribute, which would give the given format element another ID to be         used for linkage. The problem here is that expected behaviour  is         changed if a given semantic doesn't recognize this attribute. If one         writes internal references using this new id, but the given semantic         doesn't support it, so is the resulting document of broken, links don't         work like they should. This means that the document can't be ported very         easily to different semantics, which is the most important property to         avoid to align with the principles of MBDoc. <br><br>

<h1 id="Default attributes" style = "text-align: center;">3 Default attributes</h1><br>
    While attributes are something that,      <a href="#" style="color: red;">by design</a> are optionally supported by     a compiler, so are there a couple of attributes that are supported by all     the builtin compilers. These attributes are also encouraged to be supported     by custom compilers, as they most likely have familiarity and easy enough     semantics to be resuble, there are however no mandatory attributes that must     be supported. <br><br>

<h2 id="Note" >3.1 Note</h2><br>
        The note attribute is ment to put special emphasis in a particular <i>block         element</i>, possibly providing information that is extra important to have         in mind, such as when undefined behaviour is invoked, or common         misconceptions about the inteneded behaviour. <br><br>
