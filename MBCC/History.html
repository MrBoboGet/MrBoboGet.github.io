It might provide an entry point for understanding what the program is intended and not intended to do, aswell as the rationale for why things are as they are, but is not neccessary to use the program. <br><br>

<h1 id="History" style = "text-align: center;">1 History</h1><br>
    Formal languages are perhaps the most fundamental part of programming.     Programming is telling the computer what to do, and one of the best ways to     tell a computer what to do, that is both easy to input and read by both a     human and computer is through the use some language. While regular general     purpose programming languages often times are sufficent to describe what we     want to computer to do, they are not neccessary always the most efficient     way. But the overhead of implementing a domain specific langauge is often     times much to large to create a better solution. This is something I wanted     to change. <br><br>

    The motivation for the project came from when I started working on     <a href="#" style="color: red;">WarCards</a>. A wargame inspired by 40k, it features lot's of     units with movement and complicated rules, and most importantly effects.     This was when <i>the parser</i> was concieved. What if there were a way to     describe the effects in text in such a way that they could be parsed     directly to the internal representation? This would greatly speed up the     prototyping of effects and units, and even enable the user to create their     own custom units. <br><br>

    But uppon formulating this use case, I also realised that there were     multiple situations where a custom language niche language could be useful.     It didn't need to have lot of features, be general purpose programming     language, but only needed to improve some aspect of the communication with     the computer. I realised that I wanted to not create one parser but many. <br><br>

    There are plenty of compiler compilers out there. So many that the most well     known is named after that fact. The need/use for this project is not     especially unique. However, the scope might be a bit different. Many     compiler compilers support the ability to perform arbitrary code execution     during compilation time, performing both actions modifying the AST aswell as     some arbitrary function in the target language. This is not the case for     MBCC. MBCC is intended to solely be a way to easily and efficently create an     AST, aswell as being able to efficently traverse it. <br><br>

<h1 id="Design goals and guiding principles" style = "text-align: center;">2 Design goals and guiding principles</h1><br>
<h2 id="Language portability over expresiveness" >2.1 Language portability over expresiveness</h2><br>
        Parsing a language should not be a priviliged operation only permitted         to one specific program/library. A advantage of formal specification of         a language is the ability for other users to understand how it works,         and create their own tools. A parser specification that can only create         a parser for one target language destroys this advantage, and having         separate compiler specifications for each target language can also         easily become a maintenance nightmare. Every different language still         have to provide the same semantics, and creating the AST in the target         langauge can easily lead to subtle errors that harm interoperability. <br><br>

<h2 id="Only produce an AST" >2.2 Only produce an AST</h2><br>
        Many parser generators are incredibly powerful programs. They allow the         user to not only parse the text, but also evaluate it. This does         however but on a lot of constraints on the implementation of the parser.         It also makes the grammar specification not very portable across         languges. <br><br>

<h2 id="Make semantic actions unneccesary" >2.3 Make semantic actions unneccesary</h2><br>
        Semantic actions might have a purpose, and can provide functionality that         is catered to a very specific use case. The project being created on the         idea of making niche languages implementable should also not strive to         arbitrarly impede this process. It should however, make its utmost to         remove the need to include semantic actions. <br><br>

        Semantic action that are implemented in the target language are         inherently not portable, so everytime a semantic actions is needed is a         time where the parser specification becomes non-portable. <br><br>

<h2 id="Pasing decicions reside solely in the grammar" >2.4 Pasing decicions reside solely in the grammar</h2><br>
        CFG's are ultimately only a means to and end. Having a good mathematical         formalism a lot we can prove many useful properties about them, and more         easily reason about possible implementations. But their "practical"         value comes from their ability to describe the abstract syntax tree.  <br><br>

        This idea might lead one to extend the parsing decisions with conflict         handlers or other user specified code. I however think that this is         wrong. Because CFG's have another useful property, they provide a         complete specification for the syntax, and this is lost when parsing         decisions are based on user input. <br><br>

        Ambiguous grammar's aren't less ambiguous just because they get parsed         the same way by a program everytime. It only meant that production rules         are not sufficent to describe the parsing. This means that the BNF         loses it's self documentating ability and requires runtime semantics         that are inherent to the target language, and which no longer provide         any form of guarantees. Deterministic CFG's are parsable in linear time         with an algorithm that can be guaranteed to halt, something that might         not be guaranteed when aribtrary parsing decisions are provided by the         user. <br><br>

<h2 id="Improve language tooling" >2.5 Improve language tooling</h2><br>
        Creating custom languages are not only hard because of the parsing and         interpretation, but using the language efficiently also provide that         there exists some tooling. Syntax LSP capabilities such as syntax         highlightning and completion might require a completely custom LSP.         Editing white text without any help quickly becomes tedious. <br><br>

        Implementing these capabilities are often times intrinsically connected         with the parsing of the language, and most languages want to provide         mostly the same functionality to the user, and should therefor have         generic support form the parser creator. <br><br>
