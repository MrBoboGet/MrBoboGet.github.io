The compile configurations are in many ways the core of MBBuild. If there existed no compile flags that affected to produced binary and all builds used an identical configuration, MBBuild would by largely uneccesary. It does still serve as a common specification for compiling code, but it would be harder to justify converting abiding by this standard if one could just provide a makefile or cmake etc etc that just works. We do however not live in a world where this is true. We have compilers that are immensly powerful and are can be fine tuned to with specific purposes. But this does however come at a cost, and that is incompatible compile flags, and loss of optimization from not owning the complete build process. <br><br>

The MBCompileConfigurations.json is a file that describes the different compile configurations that are defined by the user. This allows a user to define <i>precisely</i> which flags and options are used when compiling ones code, and more importantly, can be made to specify these flags for <i>all</i> code, which for example allows one to utilize LTO to it's full extent, or create specific reusable configurations for purposes such as benchmarking or coverage testing code. <br><br>

This document describes the semantics of the compile configuration files, and how it is serialized. How these compile configurations are in turn utalized can be read about in the <a href="CLI.html">CLI description</a>. It is also possible to configure how different packets are linked together with different configurations, which can be read about  <a href="MBDependancySpecification.html">in MBDependancySpecification</a>. <br><br>

This document describes the functionality of compile configurations, but it isn't enough to get the complete compile command issued to compile the program. The missing flags and options are the ones that are intrinsic to fully specify the language and standard aswell as making the packet integrate with the rest of mbpm, and all of this can be read about in the  <a href="Buildsystem.html">description of the build process</a> <br><br>

<h1 id="Global compile configuration" style = "text-align: center;">1 Global compile configuration</h1><br>
    The global compile configuration is stored at      "$MBPM_PACKETS_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/Extensions/MBBuild/MBCompileConfigurations.json".     It is used during the <a href="CLI.html#compile">compile command</a>, and is used to     determine the default compile configurations. <br><br>

    Unless a      <a href="#Local compile configuration">local compile configuration is used</a>      is used, so is the file not existing treated as an error, and the     compilation is not executed and considered having failed. <br><br>

<h1 id="Local compile configuration" style = "text-align: center;">2 Local compile configuration</h1><br>
    It is possible to override which compile configuration file mbpm reads to     determine which compile configuration should parsed and used during     compilation, more about this can be read about <a href="#" style="color: red;">here</a>. <br><br>

    This functionality is provided in order to make it easy to override the     global compile configurations for a build requiring very specific flags, but     it should be used sparingly, atleast with packets under the control of mbpm.     The flags used during compilation is stored as a part of the dependancies     for every source file, meaning that different compile flags triggers a     recompilation of the source file, which means that the file is going to be     recompiled again if it's recompiled by mbpm with the default compile flags. <br><br>

<h1 id="MBCompileConfigurations.json" style = "text-align: center;">3 MBCompileConfigurations.json</h1><br>
    This part describes all of the fields in the configuration file and their     meaning, aswell as giving an overview of how the file is structured, and how     it is used during the compilation process. <br><br>

<h2 id="Compilation process overview" >3.1 Compilation process overview</h2><br>
        As MBBuild was made to be able to compile langauges with similar semantics         to C++, which was meant to support C, so are there separate compile         configurations for each language. When compiling a          <a href="MBSourceInfo.html">MBSourceInfo.json</a> so is first the          <a href="#" style="color: red;">language</a> identified, and then the         "LanguageConfigs" field in the compilation configuration is checked for         wheter or not it contains a fieldname with the same name as the          <a href="#" style="color: red;">language</a> to compile. If that field is not         found, so is no compilation made, and the compilation fails with an error. <br><br>

        Every LanguageConfig in turn specifies a couple of different fields, some         like <a href="#DefaultExportConfig">DefaultExportConfig</a> and         <a href="#DefaultConfigs">DefaultConfigs</a> which determine global defaults related         to how MBBuild handles langauges, in this example which languages are         exported and compiled if no specific configurations are given. <br><br>

        It also has the field "CompileConfigurations" which contains the actual         compilation configurations. Whenever a compilation is issued, the command         line is first searched for <a href="CLI.html#-c">"-c:{CONFIG_NAME}"</a>, which         specifies the compilation configurations to compile. If no such option is         present, the languages "DefaultConfigs" are the compilations that are         assumed. After determining the compilation configurations, it checks the         "CompileConfigurations" if configurations with the same name are present. If         not, the compilation ends with an error, and configurations are compiled. <br><br>

        The compilation configuration has a toolchain, and then checks wheter or not         the toolchain can compile the specified language for the specified standard.          If an invalid toolchain is found, or the given toolchain cannot compile the         langauge and standard combination, so is the compilation process ended with         an error. <br><br>

        The given packets are then compiled once for each configuration. More about         how to controll the compilation process from the command line can be read         about in the <a href="CLI.html">command line interface part</a>. <br><br>

<h2 id="fields" >3.2 fields</h2><br>
        MBCompileConfigurations.json is like every other config file of MBBuild         written in the JSON format, and contains both mandatory and optional         fields, and "sub objects" which in turn have optional and mandatory         fields. Missing mandatory fields results in an error parsing the file,         and any command parsing the file in turn fails with an error. Optional         fields all have specified default values, and fields not recognized as         an mandatory field or optional field are silently ignored. <br><br>

        MBCompileConfigurations.json consists of a number of subobjects with a         specific format, and all of the object types and their contents are         described in this part, beginning with the definition of the top most         object. <br><br>

<h3 id="MBCompileConfigurations.json" >3.2.1 MBCompileConfigurations.json</h3><br>
            The top most object of the file, currently only has one field, which             defines the configurations for each langauge. <br><br>

<h4 id="Mandatory fields" >3.2.1.1 Mandatory fields</h4><br>
<h5 id="LanguageConfigs" >3.2.1.1.1 LanguageConfigs</h5><br>
                    This field is a JSON object containing                      <a href="#LanguageConfig">LanguageConfig's</a>. <br><br>

                    The name of the field in the object is the name of the language                     the specific language configuration is for. <br><br>

<h4 id="LanguageConfig" >3.2.1.2 LanguageConfig</h4><br>
            A language config objects is an object that contains all of the             compile definitions and global defaults for a specficic langauge. <br><br>

<h5 id="Mandatory fields" >3.2.1.2.1 Mandatory fields</h5><br>
<h6 id="DefaultExportConfig" >3.2.1.2.1.1 DefaultExportConfig</h6><br>
                    This field is a string, and it's value is the configuration                     that is used during the <a href="CLI.html#export">export command</a> if                     no specific configurations is given. <br><br>

<h6 id="DefaultConfigs" >3.2.1.2.1.2 DefaultConfigs</h6><br>
                    This field is an array of strings. It gives the default                     export configurations to compile for packets during the                      <a href="CLI.html#compile">compile command</a> if no specific                     configuration is specified. <br><br>

<h6 id="CompileConfigurations" >3.2.1.2.1.3 CompileConfigurations</h6><br>
                    This field is an JSON object. The fieldname is the name of                     the compile configuration, and the value is a                      <a href="#CompileConfiguration">compile configuration</a> json object. <br><br>

<h4 id="CompileConfiguration" >3.2.1.3 CompileConfiguration</h4><br>
            A <a href="#CompileConfiguration">CompileConfiguration</a> and a             <a href="MBSourceInfo.html">MBSourceInfo.json</a> contains all information             neccesary to actually compile the a packet. The CompileConfiguration             contains both information about the compiler toolchain that should             be used, aswell as the extra options supplied both at link and             compile time. <br><br>

            MBBuild does however also implictly add some flags to the             compilation. These are for linking dependancies, and adding include             directories to be able to include headers from installed packets,             and include directories required by dependancies, specifying the             language for the compilation and the standard. The exact             operations required by the compiler are explained in detail at              <a href="Buildsystem.html">the buildsystem specification</a>.  <br><br>

            As being able to specify these operations are required for each             compiler, so does it also mean that MBBuild has to know about the             syntax and present options for the compiler, and in turn means that             only specific compilers are supported. The currently supported             compilers are GCC, Clang and MSVC. Compile and link flags are             however not checked for correct syntax or for being meaning full for             the compiler, and are added as is during compilation and linking,             separated by spaces. The exact behaviour of MBBuild for different             recognized toolchains can be read about <a href="#" style="color: red;">here</a>. <br><br>

<h5 id="Mandatory fields" >3.2.1.3.1 Mandatory fields</h5><br>
<h5 id="Toolchain" >3.2.1.3.2 Toolchain</h5><br>
                    The value of the "Toolchain" field is a string, specifiyng                     the name of the compiler to use. Valid values are                     "gcc","clang" and "msvc". An invalid value result in an                     error when compiling the sources. <br><br>

<h5 id="CompileFlags" >3.2.1.3.3 CompileFlags</h5><br>
                    The value of the "CompileFlags" field is an array of                     strings. <br><br>

                    Every string in the array is added to the compile command as                     is when compiling a source file. More about how compilation                     is done can be read about in the                      <a href="Buildsystem.html">build system specification</a>, and may                     have slightly differing behaviour depending on the                     toolchaing used. <br><br>

                    The compile flags are guaranteed to be added to the compile                     command in the order they are given in the array. <br><br>

<h5 id="LinkFlags" >3.2.1.3.4 LinkFlags</h5><br>
                    The value of the "LinkFlags" field is an array of strings,                     which gives the link option that are added to the command                     line whenever a target is linked.  <br><br>

                    The link flags are not checked for correct syntax or for                     existing for the current compiler.  <br><br>

                    The link flags are guaranteed to be added to the link                     command in the order they are given and command line, and                     they are furthermore guaranteed to be the last strings of                     the compile command. <br><br>

                    This is in order to ensure that system libraries added to                     the compilation are always added last, so they can resolve                     symbols for all sources and static libraries with toolchains                     that use a unix style linker. <br><br>
